    title: "No Longer Human",
    author: "Osamu Dazai",
    cover: "book_covers/human.jpg",          
    review: `The youtuber Felix Kjellberg (Pewdiepie) has also given his sentiment after reading "No Longer Human" by Osamu Dazai, alongside the revelation of the author's
    story and personal experience. No Longer Human truly embodies the story of misfortune taking life piece by piece. Embodying the title of the truly
    tragic Japanese writer. In the author's struggles with suicide attempts whilst studying in Tokyo, involved with politics and literature circles. 
    Even experiencing failed suicide attempts by himself and sometimes with lovers. Struggling with substance abuse and intense feelings of alienation.
    No longer Human for me personally, seeps as a semi-autobiography, wherein the author projects himself by communicating his emotions through a third-person perspective: a novel.
    His masterpiece was published just before his death which was caused by drowning himself alongside a lover Tomie Yamazaki in the Tamagawa Canal in Tokyo; a double suicide.
    He died at the age of 38. In the story, as you may expect, numerous unfortunate events took place upon the life of Yōzō. Beginning as a kid who hid behind
    a mask of clownish behavior but sorrowful in private. Entering adolescence he then becomes much aliented which turns him to the vices of alcohol and women. In which he enters adulthood where
    his self-destructive tendencies and addictions foster. Combined with failed relationships, betrayals, and began the suicide attempts. He now portrays the emptiness
    of feeling unworthy of love and incapable of living as a normal human being. The common themes of alienation and disconnection from society is possibly an inevitable experience. However,
    for us "normal" human beings, this specific experience tends to last for merely a short while. Often our loneliness are merely just the absence of a common responsibilities. An example would be summer break,
    during summer break, we now seldom see our friends because we are no longer bounded by any responsibility to do so which enables an isolated environment, bed rotting one's self at home.
    However, once responsibilities begin once more, we are forced to tend to our responsibilities which simultaneously requires ourselves to have a social interaction with our own personal communities. To the extent however
    that the protagonist encountered is miles different from what we expect. There may be numerous reasons as to why our environment chooses to isolate us, may it be our social status, 
    living conditions and the likes, the level of isolation presented in the novel must have had its mental impact to those that are unfortunate enough to experience it. Being surrounded in an environment
    with little to no relationships let alone shallow relationships is where in my opinion the spiral starts. The inability to teach a child reponsibility and the grit to handle life's problems 
    is one of if not the worst cultivation a caretaker can partake. Life and one's shortomings are inevitable, the mental fortitude that one has prepared for himself determines whether or not 
    they are to triumph against life's battles.

  "Meditations": {
    title: "Meditations",
    author: "Marcus Aurelius",
    cover: "book_covers/meditations.jpg",
    review: `Stoicism was the first philosophical idea I was introduced to. I assume the same goes for many others. Meditations is one of the few 
    known books which embodies the art of stoicism. For those that may not know what the term "stoicism" means, stoicism refers to the philosophical
    idea that to accept external events which are the changes that occur in life, as part of the natural course of nature. Advocating that unfortunate vicissitudes are inevitable. With the numerous
    external events life has prepared that is beyond our reach, stoicism teaches us the disparity of things that are within our control and externals events beyond our control, emphasizing the need to focus 
    on the former rather than latter. Depression, grief, pain, loneliness, some of the lot that contributes to life's sorrow, although unavoidable, stoicism does not deny them but further advocates the useless need in lamenting 
    our losses, to adhere towards acceptance. Suffering may be inevitable, but the gravity of our suffering is dictated by how much our mental capacity allows it to. We may continue to feels sorrow 
    and lament withering days, but with the philosophical idea that stoicism proposes, our emotions are within our reach, and therefore, suffering is not required to be taken to extremes. During my time in discovering 
    stoicism and later down the road, first, reading the "Discourses and Selective Writtings" of Epictetus which I later then tend to "Meditations" by Aurelius due to the difficult linguistics used in the earlier philosophical book. In my opinion,
    modern self-help books adhere towards the same philosophy as stoicism does, alongside numerous therapeutic practices in psychiatry. Practicing a stoic lifestyle from both a philosophical and emotional standpoint 
    is nothing less than logical. We as humans are bound by emotions. When met with loss, we grieve in response. However, some individuals take themselves further. As grief involves the materialistic 
    presence of both objects and of people. The greatest practitioner of stoicism is not someone that is immune to hardship, but is the one capable of embracing the inevitable. Met with clarity, and refuses to be broken by it.
    In that sense, the art of stoicism is not the act of endurance but the practice of philosophical freedom of ultimately life itself.

  "The_Hidden_Habits_of_Genius": {
    title: "The Hidden Habits of Genius",
    author: "Craig Wright, PH.D",
    cover: "book_covers/genius.jpg",
    review: `The Hidden Habits of Genius, a book I stumbled upon whilst rummaging through my mom's things was unexpectedly one of my favorite non-fictional books.
    As the title suggests, the written non-fiction talks about the habits of geniuses worldwide. From painters to scientists. There were common themes of habits that geniuses had 
    such as the lack of motivation in an academic setting, or the common theme of ADHD alongside other mental diagnoses within numerous so called "geniuses". The book in question 
    doesn't merely target their habits and mannerism though, it also talks about how those same habits shaped these geniuses into cultivating each of their own magnum opus. To be honest, 
    I found the book more of a self-help book, as the book puts emphasis on the importance of habits in shaping success. As well as making even the worst of habits comfort the worst of our own 
    as we remain bound by imperfection and it is through self-acceptance that we harness our potential. A common theme that claims whilst everyone truly is a snowflake in the sense that we are all 
    unique and different from each other, we still continue to adhere towards the same blueprint. That even the worst of us can attain success just by connecting the enough amount of dots. 
    It's in the small weird things that we do which inspire greatness and creativity. “A genius can hit a target no one else can see; a man of talent hits a target no one else can hit.” - Arthur Schopenhauer.

  "The_Stanger":{
    title: "The Stranger",
    author: "Albert Camus",
    cover: "book_covers/the_stranger.jpg",
    review: `"The stranger" was the first book I've read out of spite. The synopsis of the book follows the story of 
    Meursault, a peculiar man who represents indifference in emotions. In the first chapter, Meursault finds out about 
    the death of his mother who lived apart from him in which he takes the time off work in order to visit her, as 
    I try to recall, a retirement home. Forgive me for it has been about 2 years since I've read this book and it's only now that
    I've acted upon my thoughts on it. Anyways, Meursault frequents the habit of smoking and drinking coffee. The first peculiar thing you
    notice about the personality of this protagonist is the first line of the novel, "Maman died today. Or Yesterday maybe, I don't know". 
    When learning about the death of a loved one, usually, you are met with a plethora of emotions, depending on your past experience
    with that person. Usually however, it's either of guilt, grief, empathy, and the worst of all, regret. But Meursault, expressed none. 
    It seemed that he was more concerned of having to ask for a leave of absence at work, wondering which mode of transportation he needed to take
    in order to arrive at Maman's retirement home. It  reminded me of the novel "Metamorphosis" by Franz Kafka, in which the novel character, Gregor Samsa, woke up one morning to find
    himself transformed into a giant insect and despite this dilemma, his first thought was how it'll convene him resulting to tardiness at work.
    There are novels out there such as these that embody an entire dilemma, an entire personality into one person, showcasing to the world 
    the nuances of experiencing each emotion, each personality. I find myself to have fallen inlove with this genre of novels. Meursault exhibits
    what we consider as a "nonchalant" person, a person that exhibits no emotions or a certain stillness despite the situation. I think in the recent year, our generation has glorified
    such nonchalant behaviors, may it be in our romantic partners, or glorified to be embedded in our personality; even seen through a satire angle. 
    However, this level of "nonchalant" that Meursault exhibits didn't seem as what the average person would show. The personality of this character
    made it seem that he was incapable of experiencing emotion. Within the story, not only does he experience the death of his mother but later within
    the story, despite the caveats of his behavior, his finds himself guilty of murder. And, as you may expect, exhibits no form of remorse. Nothing 
    but plain rationalism that he did what he must. He sulked at the idea of imprisonment of course, as any person would. But, we as individuals, 
    we experience the spectrum of emotions on a day to day basis, influenced by objects such as ethics, morality, and happiness; no matter how persistent we are to deny, 
    we are humans, therefore, we are bound by emotions, decisions made from emotions. You may claim that you are pragmatic, but isn't it ego that constitute 
    your need to make such a claim? What then does life look like if none of your decisions are bound by emotions. That is the question that intrigues 
    the reader of this novel.
