        Reading was never my forte. Creativity never really came naturally to me like the others kids had. I've always thought of myself
        as more on the side of pragmatism and objectiveness. I found subject in middle-school such as English a difficult 
        endeavor for me not because I was unable to speak the language fluently but because the works we were given were subjective,
        no real metric to justify the scoring system but subjectiveness by a tutor on whether or not the criteria is met. Which is why
        mathematics and science have always been much more rational to me as for them there was merely one concrete answer to each problem.
        There was never a need for creativity, just the need to know the formula and it was simple mesmerization of those said formulas that paved high scores.
        One day I came across <a href="https://youtu.be/BG_ESa_8-zQ?list=PLpe2ydPC0gcd3qoLRvZik5mjXuLcTj0Qs&t=96" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a>
        made from one of my favorite youtubers, Pewdiepie, and for some reason, I decided to binge watch his book reviews and also came across the book reviews of Bill gates.
        I thought to myself, how does one muster the focus and patience to read an entire book, especially the books we have now are, honest to God, unreasonably thick.
